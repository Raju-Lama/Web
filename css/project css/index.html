        <h1>Owl</h1>
        <p>Owl is Owl, they cannot see in the daylight</p>
        <pre>
            Sky is blue, Owl is old, 
            Owl can see too, only at night,
            but, noone was told!

        <p>Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.

            Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn owl family, Tytonidae. Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.
            
            A group of owls is called a "parliament".</p>
