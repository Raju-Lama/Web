        <h1>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</h1>

        <p>
            <b>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</b> the city is also known, is a museum of medieval art and architecture with many examples of sculpture, woodcarving and colossal pagoda temples consecrated to different gods and goddesses which is 15 km far from Kathmandu. It is a conglomeration of pagoda and shikhara-style temples grouped around a fifty-five window palace of brick and wood. The square is one of the most charming architectural showpieces of the Valley as it highlights the ancient arts of Nepal. The golden effigies of kings perched on the top of stone monoliths, the guardian deities looking out from their sanctuaries, the wood carvings in every place-struts, lintels, uprights, tympanums, gateways and windows-all seem to form a well-orchestrated symphony. Pottery and weaving are its major traditional industries.

            Lion's Gate<br>
            This gate has two beautiful stone statues of Hindu deities installed on its either side. It is said that the hands of the artisans who produced this were cut off immediately after he gave a finishing touch to them. A jealous Bhadgaon King did this so that the artisan could not produce any more of such arts.

            Mini Pashupati Temple<br>
            Some people call it a royal dream temple. Folklore says - once a Bhadgaon King who was a great devotee to Lord Pashupati had a dream in which Lord told the king to build a temple for Pashupati right in front of this palace.
            <br>
            Vatsala Temple<br>
            This temple dedicated to a mother goddess is full of intricate works on stone. This temple is known for its dog-barking bell. This bell is believed to produce a death knell when it is rung up.
