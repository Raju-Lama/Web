        <h1>Boudhanath Stupa</h1>
        <p>
            Boudhanath Stupa, also known as Boudha Stupa, is the largest spherical stupa in the world. Located 11 km northeast of Kathmandu Valley, the capital of Nepal, it features a massive mandala covering approximately 6,756 square meters. The stupa’s dome has a diameter of 100 feet, stands 141.16 feet tall, and spans 1 hectare, making it one of the largest stupas in Nepal and globally. The area of Boudhanath Stupa is roughly three times that of the famous Swayambhunath.

            Listed in 1979 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal, Boudhanath Stupa is now among the most important tourist sites in the Kathmandu Valley. Though its date of construction is still being determined, historical records prove its construction around 600 AD. This stupa has been considered the central point of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal for centuries and the most important trading center between Tibet and Nepal—the focal point for traders and pilgrims moving between the two countries. It became a major settlement for Tibetan merchants, particularly salt traders.
            As Tibetan traders settled in the area, they introduced their culture and religious practices, thus turning Boudhanath into a key center of Tibetan Buddhism outside Tibet. This stupa is located on one of the ancient trade routes reaching the Kathmandu Valley from the village of Sankhu in the northeast. From there, the way passes by Boudhanath, and then on to the ancient, much smaller stupa of Chabahil also known as Charumati Stupa or "Little Boudhanath." From here, this route turns south, crossing the Bagmati River to Lalitpur, bypassing the later-established city of Kathmandu.
            The unique design of the Boudhanath Stupa includes a mandala, which symbolizes the universe as a sacred geometrical figure. Its main structure includes a huge white dome that symbolizes the womb of the universe. On top of the dome stands the main tower called harmika, which includes a golden spire or stupa umbrella with thirteen levels, symbolizing stages of enlightenment. One of the stupa's most recognizable features is the large, painted eyes on the four sides of the harmika. These eyes symbolize the all-seeing nature of the Buddha and are often accompanied by a third eye, symbolizing wisdom. Colorful prayer flags, or lungta, drape around the stupa, fluttering in the wind, inscribed with mantras and prayers that disseminate blessings and positive energy.
