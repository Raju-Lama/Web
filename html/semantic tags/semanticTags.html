            Semantic Tags
        We previously learned about the <div> tag to group elements. The problem with <div> is it only groups elements and tells nothing about its content.

        This is where semantic HTML tags come into play.

        Semantic tags are elements that carry meaning about the structure and content they contain.

        Unlike generic tags like <div>, semantic tags describe the purpose of the content, making it easier to understand for developers and browsers.

        For example, we can use the <nav> tag instead of <div> to represent the navigational links of a webpage.

    <!-- 
                Tag	Description
                    <header>	For the introductory content of a webpage.
                    <nav>	For navigation links.
                    <aside>	For a section that is indirectly related to the document's main content.
                    <main> 	For the main content of a webpage
                    <section>	For the generic standalone section of a document.
                    <article>	For independent, self-contained content.
                    <footer>	For the footer section of a webpage.
                    We will use these tags once we write CSS code to create a layout. For now, just remember there are alternatives to <div> for better readability.

                    Idea Emoji
                    Note: Semantic tags generally function similarly to <div>, but they provide better semantics indicating the additional meaning of your HTML document.
